what if you want a function to accept argument thats and int or a double? if you want function parameters to be optional, c++ uses a trick. 

using the process FUNCTION OVERLOADING, you can give multiple functions the same name. 

each has differnt type parameters, each has a diffreent num of parameters

What it does: Overloading enables you to change the way a function behaves depending on what is passed through the argument
